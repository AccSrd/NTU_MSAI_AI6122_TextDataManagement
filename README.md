**[AI6122] Text Data Management & Processing** is an elective course of Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence Graduate Programme **(MSAI)**, School of Computer Science and Engineering **(SCSE)**, Nanyang Technological University **(NTU)**, Singapore. The repository corresponds to the AI6122 of **Semester 1, AY2021-2022**, starting from 08/2021. **The instructor of this course is Prof. Sun Aixin.**

The projects of this course consist of **one individual Literature Review**, and **one group Project**. The topic of them are shown below, and we do not have the specific grade of them given by the prof. Since multiple people complete the group work, I do not have the right to disclose the report and others' codes individually so that the relevant parts will be hidden, and the group project only presents part of the code and report finished by myself.
